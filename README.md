# LLS_characterization_dataset

The image data for all light sheets in the paper has been uploaded to the publich data repository [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) now. The image data are splitted into three datasets due to the size limit. The DOI links  for the three datasets are 
* [https://doi.org/10.6078/D1VT6K](https://doi.org/10.6078/D1VT6K)
* [https://doi.org/10.6078/D1MB09](https://doi.org/10.6078/D1MB09)

The image data is organized for the figures in the paper Characterization, Comparison, and Optimization of Lattice Light Sheets (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.30.502108):

Within a figure folder:
*    **xzPSF.tif**: xz PSF of the light sheet for the figure
*    **cellData**: folder contains the experimental data
    
Within **cellData**:
 *   **Data**: image data for cultured cells with ER labeling
 *   **PSF**: experimental PSFs for 20ms and 2ms exposure time
    
Within **./cellData/Data**:
*    **20ms**: cell data with 20ms exposure
*   **2ms_ts**: time series image data with 2ms exposure
    
Within **./cellData/Data/20ms**:
*    **tif, csv, json, txt, sqlite3** files are the cell image data and meta data with 20ms exposure
*    **DSR**: deskew/rotated data for raw cell image data; MIPs within DSR folder contains the max intensity projection image for 3D deskew/rotated stacks.
*    **gaussian_weighted**: data with 1d smoothed enveloped weights with gaussian smoothing (the intermediate images are not included).
    
Within **./cellData/Data/20ms/gaussian_weighted**:
*    **matlab_decon**: RL deconvolution results for data weighted with 1d smoothed envelope.
    
Within **./cellData/Data/20ms/gaussian_weighted/matlab_decon**:
*    **1_debug** or **3_debug**: saving deconvolution results every 5 iterations till 200 iterations
*    **psfgen**: preprocessed PSF (removing background; remove empty regions) as input for the deconvolution program
    
Within **./cellData/Data/20ms/gaussian_weighted/matlab_decon/1_debug (or 3_debug)**:
*    tif files are deconvolution results saved every 5 interations (in skewed space)
*    **DSR**: deskew/rotated data for deconvolution results in the folder; MIPs within DSR folder contains the max intensity projection image for 3D deskew/rotated stacks.

Within **./cellData/Data/2ms_ts**:
*    tif, csv, json, txt, sqlite3 files are the cell image data and meta data with 2ms exposure; there are 100 time points.
*    **gaussian_weighted**: data with 1d smoothed enveloped weights with gaussian smoothing (the intermediate images are not included).
    
Within **./cellData/Data/2ms_ts/gaussian_weighted/matlab_decon**:
*    tif files are deconvolution results for given iterations (optimal number of iterations determined with Fourier Shell Correlation), in skewed space.
*    **MIPs**: the max intensity projection images for the tiff files in the folder.
*    **DSR**: deskew/rotated data for deconvolution results in the folder; MIPs within DSR folder contains the max intensity projection image for 3D deskew/rotated stacks.
